The way I help companies is aligning accountability across the organization to help make data-driven, financial strategies that lead to:</div>
<ul className="text-lg block justify-center p-4">
<li className="text-lg block justify-center p-4">
	Greater transparency and accountability across the organization
	</li>
	<li className="text-lg block justify-center p-4">
	Improved productivity and efficiency
	</li>
	<li className="text-lg block justify-center p-4">
	Clear objectives with outcomes
	</li>
	<li className="text-lg block justify-center p-4">
	Enhanced monitoring and reporting

My starting point is to be the bridge between you and your team.  I am Switzerland - the neutral party to pull everyone together.
</div>
<div className="text-lg justify-center p-4">
I have led hundreds of planning sessions for companies that have led to greater transparency and accountability across the organization. Hereâ€™s the secret about strategy: most companies don't need a fancy strategy, their execution needs to be optimized and education around the financial impacts.
</div>
<div className="text-lg justify-center p-4">
Whether your goal is to one day sell or scale from a 5-figure business to a 6-figure business, the objective is still the same. Creating a more valuable business by aligning cross-functional teams to work towards the same goal with clear outcomes.

<div className="text-lg justify-center p-4">
I have advised countless companies, served as President, CEO and CFO; giving me a unique perspective/experiences from all angles of the business to help you with sound advice.
